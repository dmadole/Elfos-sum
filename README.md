# Elfos-sum

This is a work-alike for the standard Elf/OS crc command but that is many times faster. This uses a pre-calculated table of input byte factors to greatly speed the calculation of CRC for the file specified. The output CRCs match those used by crc so this file can be put in place of crc if desired.
